This is my personal website. It's a mix of static and generated content. Everything is powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and countless one-off hacks.

The color scheme is [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro). The theme matches exactly what you'd see in my terminal if I opened a manual page in Neovim while using tmux.

The recommendations page is sourced from [this repository](https://github.com/PsychoLlama/recommendations) and gets rebuilt whenever I push a change.
